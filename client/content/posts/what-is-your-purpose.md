Thus I considered all my activities which my hands had done and the labor which I had exerted, and behold all was vanity and striving after wind and there was no profit under the sun.

Growing up I struggled with a poor self-image.

I believed I had to achieve perfection to be loved by God and people.

My perspective was that I didn't have value to others, and I had to focus on fixing my own problems.

Since I considered myself to be unlovable in my imperfect state, I began to seek approval from God and the people in my life by working hard to achieve "success."

Here are some things I worked on to achieve "success":
- Getting up early to read the Bible.
- Volunteering in church.
- Exercise
- Learning software engineering and having a successful career.

Despite the fact that everything listed above is considered to be good, the motivation behind my actions was important.

As I continued down the path of personal development, I began to experience the rewards of my efforts.

There was only one problem: I still felt broken inside. I still wasn't perfect. I still had a poor self-image and believed I was unlovable. No matter how hard I tried, nothing would ever be good enough.

::Scripture
---
reference: Matthew 19:16-17
---
And someone came to Him (Jesus) and said, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may obtain eternal life?” And He said to him, “Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good; but if you wish to enter into life, keep the commandments.”

::Scripture
---
reference: John 15:4-5
---
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.

I began to recognize that all of my efforts were vain apart from God. It is true that I wasn't good enough. I needed forgiveness and grace to experience the life that God wanted me to have and to fulfill the purpose He had for my life.

Next week we will continue to explore what the Scriptures say regarding our purpose for this life and throughout eternity.
